# Ultimate-Quiz, a fun quiz game!

## My app test your general knowledge about history, music, geography and alot of more categories.
- You simply choose your category/categories. 
- Three diffrent difficulties.
- How many questions per run.
- Free choice of tags, what you prefer to show up in your quiz.

I developed this app with TypeScript, Sass, AJAX and it's bundle with Parcel. 
The questions is fetched via The Trivia API, link futher down this file.

This app was a real challange for me as a frontend-student. It took me about two weeks to accomplish.
Some parts I got stuck on was the code structure. How shall I write the code to make it solid and not to much DRY.
The key for me was to build short functions within a object.
Thanks to my dear classmates, google and youtube I manage it all to the end.

## How to run the app localy

1) Clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Phillipe-Jarnefors/Ultimate-Quiz.git

3) Install dev dependencies:

4) Start the dev server that will watch for saved changes to your SCSS-files and TS-files:
