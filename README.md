I developed this app with TypeScript, Sass, AJAX and it's bundle with Parcel. 
The questions is fetched via The Trivia API, link futher down this file.

This app was a real challange for me as a frontend-student. It took me about two weeks to accomplish.
Some parts I got stuck on was the code structure. How shall I write the code to make it solid and not to much DRY.
The key for me was to build short functions within a object.
Thanks to my dear classmates, google and youtube I manage it all to the end.

1) Clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Phillipe-Jarnefors/Ultimate-Quiz.git
